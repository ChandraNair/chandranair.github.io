<STRONG> <font color=purple> RESEARCH INTERESTS </font> </STRONG>
<p>

My research has been primarily focused on issues arising in network information theory and 
combinatorial optimization problems. I have also been  involved in the analysis of
algorithms arising in the above areas as well as some originating in queuing theory, networks,
energy-efficient scheduling in sensor networks, etc. Most of the above research has been motivated by
a seemingly innate attraction towards certain problems containing elements of probability and combinatorics.


<p>
For the last two to three years my research has primarily focussed on some fundamental
unresolved issues in network information theory. Before this my research mainly dealt with
theoretical issues connected to combinatorial optimization problems in both finite and large systems, primarily
motivated by conjectures posed by statistical physicists. Apart from these two long-term affairs, I have 
also had brief fancy for a bunch of isolated issues, mostly as a collaborator with some very interesting 
colleagues.

<p>

Since Fall 2007 I have been an assistant professor in the
Information Engineering(<a href="http://www.ie.edu.hk">IE</a>) department at 
the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
From Fall 2008 I am also serving as an assistant director of the Institute of 
Theoretical Computer Science and Communication(<a href="http://www.ie.edu.hk">ITCSC</a>).


<p>
<STRONG> <font color=purple> Past: </font> </STRONG>
<p>

From Summer 2005-Summer 2007 I spent two wonderful years in Redmond as a post-doc with the 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/theory/">
theory group 
</a> at Microsoft Research. It was during this period that I changed my research focus from Combinatorial
Optimization problems to Network Information Theory.

<STRONG> <font color=purple> EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND </font> </STRONG>

<p>
I did my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institue of Technology(<a href="http://www.iitm.ac.in">IIT</a>
), Madras in electrical engineering graduating in 1999. Concurrently, I also completed the four year nurture programme in 
Mathematics at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences(<a href="http://www.imsc.res.in">IMSc</a>
) under the auspices of the National Board of Higher Mathematics(<a href="http://www.nbhm.dae.gov.in">NBHM</a>).</p>

<p>
I received a Masters (2002) and PhD (2005) in 
electrical engineering from <a href="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>.
The title of my dissertation was
<cite> Proofs of the Parisi and Coppersmith-Sorkin conjectures in the random assignment problem</cite>
(<a href="pub/papers/comb/PhDthesis.pdf">PDF</a>),
and 
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~balaji/">
Balaji Prabhakar
</a>
was my advisor. Following postdoctoral
position at the theory group in Microsoft Research,
 I joined the IE department faculty in CUHK.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: I am always interested in working with good students, primarily those having strong mathematical reasoning 
skills. The IE department in CUHK is not a bad place for a graduate career even comparing to some good schools 
in United States. We, the department, are on the lookout for very strong gradute students from all over the world.

<ul>
<li><STRONG>WEBID</strong>: This is a project I am undertaking with some final year undergradutes. The purpose of 
this project is to have a secure self-synchronizing contacts manager that also synchronizes with your mobile phone. For instance, 
if I change my mobile number today then the system automatically updates my number in the mobile phones of my 
allowed contacts within 24 hours, so that they can reach me at my new number. They may not even realize that I changed my number
- who remembers phone numbers anyway these days. I am not sure I am making friends with mobile carriers though. Expected date of 
public beta release : March 2010.</li>
<li><STRONG>BC-SOFTWARE</strong>: A software for automatically generating achievable regions for a 
given broadcasting scenario. Essentially, a Fourier-Motzkin elimination tool, this incorporates redundancy checks specifically
catered to redundancies occuring in network information thoeretic constraints. Expected release date: March 2010.
The main contributors to this project are Arvind Ramachandran, Zizhou Wang, and Carrie Chow.</li>
<li><STRONG>CYCLING</strong>: A part-time hobby for me during my graduate and post-doctoral years. I occasionally still venture out but Hong Kong 
is not very bicycle friendly. I am one of the
co-founders (along with head honcho: Sergei Morozov) of the website: <a href="http://cycling.stanford.edu">
Stanford Cycling - the unofficial webpage</a>, a page still hosted on my advisor's computer system. (ssshhhh!)</li>
